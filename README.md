#egfx
Graphics library created from urge to understand graphics coding. I've used trial - error - study method here. It means that first I try to solve the problems by my self and after that checked out commonly used methods if needed.

Inspiration to make this came from tsodings [olive.c](https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c).

### Build test && run test && check output
```
gcc egfx.c test.c -o test
./test
feh test.ppm
```
